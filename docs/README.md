## What You Need to Know

We walk your dog and pick up your dog’s poop. We will walk your dog for 30
minutes, and it doesn’t take us more than 20 minutes to pick up your dog’s
poop. Also, you have 3 choices: Bronze, Silver, or Gold membership. We are
really responsible and will take good care of your dog’s when we walk your
dogs.


## Payment Policy

**Payment Plan:** We will not allow debit card, credit card, check, or gift
card. We will only allow cash. **No Payment:** If you don’t pay your bill when
it is due then it will cost you $5 extra dollars each time you miss a week with
the amount you need to pay each week. **Amount to Pay:** It depends on what
membership you sign up for. If you sign up for the Bronze,
then you pay $5 a week. If you sign up for the Silver, then you pay $10 a week.
If you sign up for the Gold, then you pay $15.


## Cancellation Policy

**How to Cancel:** You call the number on the member card and give us the date
on when you want to cancel the membership. **When You Cancel:** You are allowed
to cancel the membership at any time of the membership. But you are not allowed
to cancel it before the first week.
